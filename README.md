Acknowledgment:
This project was developed as part of the ITPE3200 group exam and was heavily inspired by the course demos created by the course lecturer Baifan Zhou. These demos were used as references and learning tools to understand key concepts such as database integration, authentication, logging, and more.

While the group aimed to create original work, some parts of the implementation may resemble the demos provided during the course. We credit the course lecturer Baifan Zhou for any similarities in the code.
